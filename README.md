# What it does
Using echoAR once you scan the QR code and print the image you can eat your own holographic food just like plankton.

# How we built it
Used HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the webpage and echoAR handled the QR code scaning and displaying of 3d models

# Challenges we ran into
Main challange I ran into were my own different ideas to do with echoAR, I had a few different ideas before this but I couldnt figure out to do everything on my own so I decided to stick to something more simple easier to do.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
It was my first time using HTML/CSS/JavaScript so I am proud of being able to make a proper site and also being able to use
echoAR.

# What we learned
Learned how echoAR worked and its uses and also HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
